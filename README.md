Make a simple banking app:

1-Front End:

    a) 1st will be login page where the user will be able to login by username and password (Registeration is not on scope of that app-users can be inserted directly on DB)

    b) 2nd will be a landing page which will bring up the banking profile of the user

        - Simple info profile
        
            1)Name
        
            2)Photo if exist and if not a place holder will be shown
    
        - Accounts info Swiper (Each item show account number/type/balance)
    
        - Latest transactions list
            
        - Global services like branch locator, currency convertor, chatbot, etc..

2-BackEnd:

    a) NodeJs server integrated with MongoDB which will carry out the set of APIs needed

    b) Server will be hosted in Heroku or Amazon (Heroku is more simpler/easier https://www.heroku.com/) and the app will connect to the deployed instance

3- You will need to commit two projects

    a)Ionic Mobile project (Latest Ionic version should be used)
    
    b)Nodejs Project + hosting it to Heroku or Amazon

4- You could replace Mobile app (Ionic) by Angular Internet Banking Web app if more familier with (Latest Angular version should be used)
